<h1> Things To Remember </h1>
<br>
<b> Navigating and Viewing The Internet </b>
<br>
<p>
  Understanding that the internet is really a web of computers interacting with each other thru commands and computer language. Anytime a person wants to "<em>go somewhere</em>" on the internet they have to type in an address on their browser like www. udacity.com and the computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. <a href="https://www.udacity.com"> Udacity </a> is where you end up. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
</p>
<br>
<b>HTML</b>
<br>
<p>
  HTML stands for <em><b>Hypertext Markup Language.</em></b> HTML documents make up most of what we see on the internet. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. Here is an example <img src="http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#/media/File:HTML_logo.png" alt="HTML PIC"> </p>
<br>
<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<br>
<p>
  HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. < br > is an empty element without a closing tag.
</p>
<br>
<b> Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<br>
<p>
  HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. Some examples of inline elements are : a, span, br, img, and strong. Some box elements are: p, div, and form.
